++Evaluation Context :

	TotalSales := SUM (Sales[SalesAmount])
	NOTE : Numbers are sliced by color, i.e. the formula 
	is NOT computing sum of sales, it is computing it 
	for only a subset of the data model

THE VALUE OF A FORMAL DEPENDS ON ITS CONTEXT
+Sources of the context :
	PivotTable Filter
	Columns
	Rows
	Slicers

+ Rows outside of the filter context:
	are not considered for the computation
+ Defined automatically by PivotTable

++ ROW CONTEXT :
	Defined by :
		Calculated column defintion
			Defined automatically for each row
		Row Iteration functions :
			SUMX, AVERAGEX
			All X functions and iterators
			Defined by the user formulas 
	Needed to evaluate column values "current row"

	SUMX (Orders, [Quantity]*[Price])

++THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO CONTEXTS:
	Filter context :
		Filters tables 
		Might be empty
			all the tables are visible
			but this never happens in the real world
	Row context :
		Iterates rows
		for the rows active in the filter context	
		might be empty 
			There is no iteration running
BOTH ARE EVALUATION CONTEXTS
