++ Evaluation Contexts And Relationship:

bidirectionnal filtering 

Do context interact with relationships ?
Row Context 
Filter Context
One side
Many side

=----------------------
+ ROW CONTEXT :
Does not propagate over relationships

MANY TO ONE : RELATED
ONE O MANY : RELATEDTABLE

---
+ FILTER CONTEXT - Many Tables

-Filter Context and relationships
  Relationships affect filter context
-Orders -> Products
 Filter context on orders
 follow the relationship
 show only products of the selected orders

=------------------------
+ CONTEXT TRANSITION :
Calculate performs another task
if executed inside a row context
 - it takes the row context
 - Transforms is into an equivalent filter
 - Applies it to the data model
 - before computung its expression

Very important ans useful feature
 - Better to learn it writing some 


AUTOMATIC CALCULATE 

Whenever a measure is cpmuted, an aitomaic CALCULATE
id ADDED around the measure

SUMX (
	Orders,
	[Sales Amount]
)

SUMX (
	Orders,
	CALCULATE ([Sales Amount])
)
