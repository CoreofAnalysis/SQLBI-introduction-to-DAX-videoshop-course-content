+++CALCULATE :
IS THE ONLY function in DAX that has the power of 
changing and updating the filter context

+ Filters are evaluated in the outer filter context, 
then combined together, and then finally used to build
a new filter context into which DAX evaluates

CALCULATE (
	Expression,
	Filter1,
	...
	Filter N // REpeated MANY TIMES, AS NEEDED
)
Example :
Compute the sum of sales where the price is more 
then 10000$.

NumOfBigSales :=

CALCULATE (
	SUM (Sales[SalesAmount]),
	Sales[SalesAmount] > 100
)

++ FIlTERS ARE TABLES
Each filter is a table, boolean expressions are
nothing but shortcuts for table EXPRESSIONS

CALCULATE (
	SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
	Sales[SalesAmount] > 100
)

IS EQUIVALANT TO 

CALCULATE(
	SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
	FILTER(
		ALL(Sales[SalesAmount]),
		Sales[SalesAmount] > 100
	)
)
------------
Clear filter on one column 
CALCULATE (
	SUMX(
		Orders,
		Orders[Amount]	
	),
	ALL( Orders[Channels])
)	

++ Calculate tasks:
Partially replaces the filter context 
Conditions
	Can replace a whole table
	Can replace a single column
CALCULATE works on the filter context.
