Basic functiond that work on full tables
	FILTER
	ALL
	VALUES
	DISTINCT
	RELATEDTABLE
Their result os often used in other full 
They can be combined together

++CALCULATED TABLES:
in the newest versions of Tabular 
you can create calculated tables

++ Filtering tables
SUMX(
	FILTER(
		Orders,
		Orders[Price] > 1
	),
	Orders[Quantity] * Orders[Price]
	)	
FILTER :
Adds a bew condition
Restricts the number of rows of a table
Returns a table
Cab  be iterated by an "X" function

Needs a table as input
The input can be another filter

++ REMOVING FILTERS:
 ALL : is a very simple finctoin that retuns the full table you pass as
	a parameter.

ALl Sales Amount = 
SUMX(
	ALL(Sales),
	Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Net Price] )
Sales % = 
	ALL:
		Returns all the rows of a table 
		Ignores the filter context
		Returns a table
		That can be iterated by an 'X' function
	 Needs a table as input
	 can br used with a single column 
		ALL (Customers[CustomerName])
		The result contains a table with one column 
++ MIXING FILTERS :

	Table functions can be mixed 
	Each one requires a table
	Each one return a table
	FILTER ( ALL ( Table), Condition )
		Puts a filter over the entire table
		Ignores the current filter context

++ DISTINCT :
	Return the distinct values of a column, only the ones visible in the corrunt context

	NumofProducts :=
		COUNTROWS (
			distinct (Product[ProductCode])

++ RELATEDTABLE
	Returns a table with all the rows related with the corrutn one.:
	NumofProducts :=
		COUNTROWS (
			RELATEDTABLE( Product )

	starts from the many side and gave me the access to the one side 
	

	Sales of Customer =
		SUMX (
			RELATEDTABLE (Sales),
			Sales[Quanitty] * Sales [Net Price])
